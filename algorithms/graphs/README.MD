**Definition**
Data structures composed of nodes and edges

**Key Terms**
- Nodes
- Edges
- Cyclic / undirected Graph 
- Acyclic / directed Graph
- Visited
- Depth First Traversal
- Breadth First Traversal
- Stack
- Queue


**Strategy**
- Learn to build graphs from edges
- Traverse nodes using depth first search or breadth first search
- If undirected graph, keep track of visited nodes
