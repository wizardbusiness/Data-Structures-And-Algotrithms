**Definition**
Noticing larger patterns in the recursive nature of problems and optimizing them so that you don't
do the same calculation twice

**Strategy**
1. Make it work
2. Make it efficient

- Visualize the problem as a tree
- Implement using recursion
- Identify duplicate branches of the tree

**Memoization Recipe**
1. Make it work
  - visualize as a tree
  - implement tree using recursion
  - test un memoized solution

2. Make it efficient
  - add a memo object
  - add a base case to return memo values 
  - store return values into the memo

**Key Terms**
- Memoization
- Tabulation
